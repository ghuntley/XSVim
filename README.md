# Installation

Interact with Visual Studio for Mac as follows:

```
Visual Studio -> Extensions -> Gallery -> IDE Extensions -> "VIM" -> Install
```

Then close the current document that you are working on and open a new document to activate the plugin. If that doesn't work, restart Visual Studio

# Looking for the latest release?

Check the [release page](https://github.com/nosami/XSVim/releases) as there is usually a more recent version of the addin here than on the Visual Studio for Mac feed. Grab the .mpack file and install it via Visual Studio -> Extensions -> Install from file
